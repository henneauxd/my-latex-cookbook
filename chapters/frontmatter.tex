% Helper file that pulls subchapters together.

% Set initial pages to alpha, so that they do not collide with later Arabic numbering
% in the generated PDF. This won't show in print because page numbers aren't displayed
% until later. But you will be able to print the title page by printing page 'a', which
% would otherwise overlap with page '1', aka the first actual text page.
